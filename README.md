```

### Command Line Usage

#### Basic Usage
```bash
# Generate 10 basic dork queries for a target
python google_dorker.py -t example.com

# Generate queries for specific category
python google_dorker.py -t example.com -c file_discovery

# Generate advanced queries with keywords
python google_dorker.py -t example.com -k admin,login,config

# Save results to file
python google_dorker.py -t example.com -o results.json
```

#### Advanced Options
```bash
# Generate more queries
python google_dorker.py -t example.com -n 20

# Hide ethical warnings (not recommended)
python google_dorker.py -t example.com --no-warnings

# Generate OSINT queries
python google_dorker.py -t example.com --osint
```

### Example Output
```
[1] FILE_DISCOVERY
Query: site:example.com filetype:pdf
Description: Discover documents on target website (pdf files)
Risk Level: Medium
Use Case: Find pdf files on example.com
Google URL: https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aexample.com+filetype%3Apdf
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[2] DIRECTORY_LISTING
Query: site:example.com intitle:index.of
Description: Find directory listings on target
Risk Level: High
Use Case: Security assessment of example.com
Google URL: https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aexample.com+intitle%3Aindex.of
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

## Configuration

The tool uses `config.json` for settings:

```json
{
  "settings": {
    "delay_between_requests": 2,
    "max_queries_per_category": 5,
    "default_query_count": 10,
    "enable_ethical_warnings": true
  },
  "categories": {
    "file_discovery": {
      "enabled": true,
      "priority": 1,
      "risk_threshold": "medium"
    }
  }
}
```

## Algorithm Details

### Query Generation Algorithm
1. **Template Selection**: Choose from 50+ pre-defined dork templates
2. **Target Integration**: Insert target domain into appropriate query positions
3. **Extension Variation**: Generate multiple queries for different file types
4. **Risk Assessment**: Assign risk levels based on potential impact
5. **Categorization**: Organize queries by reconnaissance purpose

### Advanced Features
- **Smart Template Matching**: Algorithms select most effective templates for target
- **Risk-Based Filtering**: Filter queries by risk level
- **Contextual Keywords**: Generate relevant keywords based on target analysis
- **Query Optimization**: Remove redundant or ineffective queries
